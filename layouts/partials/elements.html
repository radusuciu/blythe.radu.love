                    <p>Alternatively, if you would like more space or plan to share accommodations with other friends or family, we highly recommend taking advantage of Airbnb or other short-term rental options. San Diego has an eclectic mix of neighborhoods, with lots of options for dining and going out. North Park, close to Balboa Park, offers a more local experience with an artsy flair. If you're looking for more traditional nightlife, Downtown Gaslamp District or Little Italy are also close by. For those looking for a beach experience, check out La Jolla (upscale, pronouced Lah HOY-ah), Pacific Beach (bro-oriented the closer you get to Garnet Ave.), or Ocean Beach (get in touch with your inner hippie), though they're a bit further from the venue.</p>
