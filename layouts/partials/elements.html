                    <p>We are currently looking into the possibility of a room block at a hotel in the area; however, we do not have specifics just yet. The venue is in Balboa Park which is centrally located in San Diego. If youâ€™d like to get moving on hotel reservations now, popular hotel areas would be downtown San Diego or on Hotel Circle Drive.</p>

                    <!-- <p>Alternatively, if you would like more space or plan to share accommodations with other friends or family, we highly recommend taking advantage of Airbnb or other short-term rental options. North Park and Mission Hills are super cute neighborhoods close to Balboa Park that have options for shopping and dining out. Downtown San Diego, which is also close to Balboa Park, is more urban and has many options for dining and going out. For those looking for a beach experience, check out La Jolla, Pacific Beach, or Mission Bay.</p> -->

                    <p>Alternatively, if you would like more space or plan to share accommodations with other friends or family, we highly recommend taking advantage of Airbnb or other short-term rental options. San Diego has an eclectic mix of neighborhoods, with lots of options for dining and going out. North Park, close to Balboa Park, offers a more local experience with an artsy flair. If you're looking for more traditional nightlife, Downtown Gaslamp District or Little Italy are also close by. For those looking for a beach experience, check out La Jolla (upscale, pronouced Lah HOY-ah), Pacific Beach (bro-oriented the closer you get to Garnet Ave.), or Ocean Beach (get in touch with your inner hippie), though they're a bit further from the venue.</p>
