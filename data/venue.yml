  Both the ceremony and reception will be taking place at the <a href="https://www.sdnhm.org/">San Diego Natural History Museum</a>, located in Balboa Park. The cocktail hour will take place on level 2 where you'll be free to roam throughout the exhibits. If you'd like to see more of the museum, you are welcome to arrive early and explore before the ceremony. Youâ€™ll be able to enter free of charge - just say that you're there for the wedding. We hope you enjoy experiencing the unique natural history of the beautiful Southern California-Baja California region!
